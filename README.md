### 🚫 Banned Posts Helper

- Shows missing banned posts when doing similar image search.
- Easier 1up + Shows similar banned posts on upload page.

#### [Install](/src/banned-posts-helper.user.js?raw=1)

### 👩‍🎨 Strikethrough for banned artists

Since banned artist names can’t be styled using simple CSS selectors, the script retrieves data for all banned artists.

You can configure the data update interval and specify which types of elements to style at the beginning of the script.

#### [Install](/src/strikethrough-banned-artists.user.js?raw=1)

### 📳 Vibrate on Vote or Favorite

> Inspired by the like vibration on Twitter mobile site.

Trigger vibration on supported devices when voting or favoriting.\
This script does not work in browsers that do not support the vibration API (e.g. Firefox).

#### [Install](/src/vote-favorite-vibrate.user.js?raw=1)

### 🔍 Sticky Search Bar

Makes the search bar stick to the top of the page.

I only recently realized this is actually a small feature from [Danbooru EX](https://danbooru.donmai.us/forum_topics/13167). However, this version includes some improvements:

* Better experience on mobile devices.
* Fixed the autocomplete dropdown menu.

[Install](/src/sticky-search-bar.user.js?raw=1)

Save the content in textboxes on the upload page automatically, including tags and translated commentary.

#### [Install](/src/auto-saver.user.js?raw=1)

### 📝 Notify on Note Box Changes

Displays position and size information while the user adjusts the note box via dragging or keyboard shortcuts.

#### [Install](/src/note-box-change-notice.user.js?raw=1)

### ✋ Tap to Show Tooltip

> [!TIP]
> If you've installed the [More Tooltips](#speech_balloon-more-tooltips), this one can be skipped.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a userscript optimized for touchscreen devices.

Originally, this was just a bug fix for Android System WebView-based browsers that couldn’t show tooltips on long press, unlike Firefox or Chrome for Android.\
Now, users can simply click to display the voter tooltip or favoritor tooltip and then click again to navigate to the target page.

#### [Install](/src/tap-to-show-tooltip.user.js?raw=1)

### 🌐 Full-width Character Converter

This userscript is designed for users who work with CJK characters. It automatically converts full-width characters to half-width ones (`：` → `:`, `（）` → `()`, etc.) when searching and doing tag gardening. This helps you avoid manually switching your IME or toggling between full-width and half-width modes.

#### [Install](/src/full-width-char-converter.user.js?raw=1)

### 🖼 Draggable Post Image

Makes image draggable like yande.re. Drag function was modified from [Moebooru](https://github.com/moebooru/moebooru/blob/e7bd4e98411f2b14619f1f2aa32901ec05904c39/app/javascript/src/moebooru.coffee#L10).\
You can prevent the image from moving by pressing the Ctrl or Alt key while adding a note box.

#### [Install](/src/draggable-image.user.js?raw=1)

> [!TIP]
> If you've installed the [More Tooltips](#speech_balloon-more-tooltips), this one can be skipped.

Some users don't like adding posts to their favorites may add them to their favorite groups.\
This simple userscript shows how many public favorite groups the current post has been added to.

#### [Install](/src/favgroup-count.user.js?raw=1)
